To run pvc requires an existing installation of node.js.

It's presumed you are reading this INSTALL file after
cloning the GitHub project or unpacking a release tarball
and changing into the resulting directory.

To run PVC as an ordinary user without a system wide installation,
first run:
	npm install
which will create a directory named "node_modules" and download some
nodejs modules into it.

From now on, always cd to the directory you're now in and
prefix any pvc commands with "./" e.g.
	./pvc config show


To install PVC system wide, run (as root):
	make install
then run pvc commands like any other command from anywhere you like.
